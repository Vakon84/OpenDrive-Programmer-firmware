# OpenDrive-Programmer-firmware
The firmware needed by the OpenDrive Programmer MCU

It handles all necessary signaling for reading and writing the flashcart. Not much to say about it, mostly interesting to programmers and to learn about.

Needs a STLink to be written to the STM32.

Sugestions are welcome!

# Disclaimer
I'm not a expert programmer, also not really a good one, also this is a one person project. The code may not be beautiful, it may not even be good coding. If any problems or sugestions arrise, please contact me. Also if anybody knows better about programming and wants to develop this furter, be my guest. The documentation may also lack things that I forgot write down, if so, please tell me and i'll be happy to explain and add the information.
